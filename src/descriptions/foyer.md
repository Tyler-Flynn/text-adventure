	It was in the middle of the Fall, you were walking through the woods not far from your home whenever something catches
your eye, hidden amongst a thicket of dead trees stands a tall and perhaps at one point luxurious palace of sort, a manor. The once ivory paint that coated its exterior finds itself faded and peeling, the old iron gates are oxidized in rust and creak, the doors stand tall and intimidating, carved of oak with large Lion's head knockers.

	As you come to a stop before the door you raise and release one of the heavy knockers, it soudns through the thick ancient
wood echoing from the other side, yet after several moments wait no one comes to the door. You contemplate and after a few moments you curiosity gets the better of you and you try for the door, it opens with a loud hesitant creak.

	You step inside and find yourself in the foyer of an old manor, the interior is covered in cobwebs and dust, the building
seems to havebeen abandonded years ago.

	In the foyer there is a {ITEM:coatrack} and a {ITEM:cupboard} as well as two connecting doors, one to the left side and
one tothe right side as well as a Staircase that leads upstairs though it does not seem to be in the best shape anymore.
