	This room appears much in the same fashion as the last one however though as you enter you find a bigger chill than before
running down your spine as you  realsie the room is torn to bits furniture strewn about the room everywhere and on the wall a crimson handprint, you can only hope that is paint... Everything about this room sceams at you to run back out the exit!
